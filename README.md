# RFID_Light-Switch
Requires an Arduino, a relay and an RFID model MFRC522. The RFID Library can be found at https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid
Video demo can be found at https://youtu.be/EbzrWfhGOdg
Future work on this project is to be able to add or to change to other rfid tags using a password.
